<Question>: What is the meaning of Hindu in the Arabic dictionary?
<Document>: Hindus: The word Hindu is derived from the Indo - Aryan and Sanskrit word Sindhu, which means ``a large body of water '', covering`` river, ocean''. It was used as the name of the Indus river and also referred to its tributaries. The actual term 'hindu' first occurs, states Gavin Flood, as ``a Persian geographical term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus (Sanskrit: Sindhu) '', more specifically in the 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I. The Punjab region, called Sapta Sindhava in the Vedas, is called Hapta Hindu in Zend Avesta. The 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I mentions the province of Hi (n) dush, referring to northwestern India. The people of India were referred to as Hinduv\u0101n (Hindus) and hindav\u012b was used as the adjective for Indian in the 8th century text Chachnama. The term 'Hindu' in these ancient records is an ethno - geographical term and did not refer to a religion. The Arabic equivalent Al - Hind likewise referred to the country of India.

<Question>: What band was Nick Rhodes a member of?
<Document>: Only After Dark (album): \"Only After Dark\" is a compilation album that was compiled by Nick Rhodes and John Taylor from Duran Duran, and recreates a night at Birmingham's Rum Runner nightclub, during the post punk days of the late 70s/early 80s when a new sound of glam/punk/electronica started to crystallize. The CD captures some of the discs that Nick spun when he was deejaying for Â£10 a night at the club and Duran Duran were the resident band. The inspiration for it came when in 2000 John and Nick spent hours selecting 50 tracks for a 4-hour radio broadcast entitled \"A Night At The Rum Runner\". The 18 track CD was released on 8 May 2006 and presented in a silver gatefold card sleeve in shocking pink metallic print featuring photographs taken from this period, first published in the book \"Duran Duran Unseen\" by Paul Edmond, the front cover photo being of fashion designer Patti Bell.

<Question>: Who has established herself as a Queen of Popular Music?
<Document>: Madonna (entertainer): Madonna's music has been the subject of much analysis and scrutiny. Robert M. Grant, author of Contemporary Strategy Analysis (2005), commented that what has brought Madonna success is \"certainly not outstanding natural talent. As a vocalist, musician, dancer, songwriter, or actress, Madonna's talents seem modest.\" He asserts Madonna's success is in relying on the talents of others, and that her personal relationships have served as cornerstones to the numerous reinventions in the longevity of her career. Madonna's approach was far from the music industry wisdom of \"Find a winning formula and stick to it.\" Her musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images and a constant quest for new heights of fame and acclaim. Grant concluded that \"having established herself as the queen of popular music, Madonna did not stop there, but continued re-inventing.\" Musicologist Susan McClary wrote that \"Madonna's art itself repeatedly deconstructs the traditional notion of the unified subject with finite ego boundaries. Her pieces explore various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition.\"
<Answer>: Madonna
<Thought>:
1. The words "established herself" and "queen of popular music" from the document refer to the question.
2. "Madonna" from the document refers to the answer.
